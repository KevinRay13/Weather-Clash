## About Weather Clash
WC was a coding challenge given to me. I was tasked with building a web app that could take two unputed cities and then pick a winner based on the weather stats recieved from an API.

## Exciting Challenges
Creating a point system to assign points to undesirable weather conditions was a fun challenge to wrap my mind around. The winner would end up being the city with the least amount of points after checking each cities conditions. I also built this project in Angular, being newer to Angular this presented a difficult challenge but before long I was starting to enjoy the features Angular provides. 

## Tech Used
